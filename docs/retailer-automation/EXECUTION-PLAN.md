# Retailer Automation Consolidation Execution Plan

**Status: RA-003 VERIFIED COMPLETE**

**Current active task:** none — RA-003 is `VERIFIED_COMPLETE`; RA-004 remains
`NOT_STARTED`

**Implementation:** RA-003 independently verified; no production wiring

**Allowed statuses:** `NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `BLOCKED`,
`READY_FOR_VERIFICATION`, `VERIFIED_COMPLETE`

Only one RA task may be active. Task numbering for retailer migrations is an
inventory key, not an approved execution sequence. No task may become
`VERIFIED_COMPLETE` without the listed local and live evidence.

## Common evidence fields

Every task records:

- commit SHA:
- PR:
- GitHub run ID(s):
- artifact ID(s), digest(s) and retained path(s):
- local verification:
- production readback:
- owner approval reference:
- rollback result:

## RA-000 — Baseline and audit

**Status:** `VERIFIED_COMPLETE`

**Goal:** establish an evidence-backed baseline without changing runtime code.

**Scope:** retailer inventory, real flow map, shared/duplicate mechanisms,
exceptions, incident taxonomy, current Actions/readback evidence and this plan.

**Out of scope:** refactor, workflow/migration/database changes, approvals and
production writes.

**Dependencies:** owner verification. The original local/production baseline
mismatch was resolved by rebuilding RA-000 alone on a clean branch from current
`origin/main`; no runtime implementation dependency was opened.

**Existing solutions checked:** Operating Plan, Agent Operating Model,
Automation Reliability Roadmap/Owner Decisions, Data Source Registry, onboarding
runbook, offer-sync core, snapshot core, atomic importer, Review Queue,
postflight, watchdog, migrations/tests and Git history.

**Acceptance:** all 12 active retailers documented; every material claim cites a
file/symbol/run/artifact; unknowns are explicit; documentation-only diff; pre/post
Project Guardian passes; original dirty worktree remains unchanged; closeout
branch starts at exact current `origin/main`.

**Tests:** `npm run verify:project` before and after; documentation link checks;
`git diff --check`.

**Evidence:** this directory and evidence index; original local audit baseline
`1add3449096cbc3f988d0e5f6db8b9baf89f0349`; original and current fetched
production-run SHA `121fc5ce909c925e7234aef3a249661c8e7d0826`; merge-base
`1add3449096cbc3f988d0e5f6db8b9baf89f0349`, ahead/behind `0/104`; current
runs listed in evidence.

**Rollback:** revert only these documentation/AGENTS edits; no runtime rollback.

**Recorded evidence fields:** commit SHA: the Git commit containing this plan;
run IDs: documentation audit uses read-only runs only; artifacts: see evidence
index; local verification: pre-edit Project Guardian PASS, final results are
recorded in the commit/branch handoff; production readback: read-only artifacts
only; owner approval reference: pending verification; rollback result: not
applicable because no runtime change was made.

**Independent verification — 23 September 2026:** verified against
`121fc5ce909c925e7234aef3a249661c8e7d0826` with documentation commit
`8745b8bbc7fd9f7f8b324bcef69b3cac00c8ef75`. Project Guardian, documentation
links, diff whitespace, exact six-file scope, task-status contract and original
dirty-worktree integrity checks passed. The review confirmed that audit claims
remain evidence-backed, unknowns remain explicit, architecture remains a draft,
and all approval/write guardrails are preserved. No SQL, import, approval,
apply, workflow dispatch or staging/production write was performed.

## RA-001 — Approve architecture and status taxonomy

**Status:** `VERIFIED_COMPLETE`

**Goal:** prepare an evidence-backed owner decision on the common core,
component boundaries, six-dimensional status taxonomy, blocking scope,
automatic execution authority, exceptions and migration order.

**Scope:** compare all current production and harness paths; propose at most
three architectures and authorization models; recommend one target pipeline;
record no more than five plain-language owner decisions in
`RA-001-DECISION-PACK.md`.

**Out of scope:** implementation or guardrail changes.

**Dependencies:** RA-000 `VERIFIED_COMPLETE` and clean current baseline.

**Existing solutions checked:** `retailer-offer-sync`, `retailer-snapshot`,
atomic importer, shared Fit House engine, dedicated eBay/6 Pack/Whey Okay/GYM
HIGH/Jon's and catalogue-onboarding paths, validator/approver/executor, Review
Queue, control ledger, shared and dedicated postflight/watchdog mechanisms,
their tests, workflows, migrations and current RA-000 evidence.

**Acceptance:** owner approval dated 2026-09-23 confirms the pack's traceable
20-dimension comparison, one clear
recommendation, one logical pipeline, explicit connector/core boundary, status
and authorization models, exception governance, event-based migration gates,
retirement conditions, risks, unknowns and five owner decisions. The approval
retains every implementation, shadow, cutover, auto-safe and decommission gate.

**Tests:** pre/post `npm run verify:project`, documentation link check,
`git diff --check`, allowed-scope/status/integrity checks; no runtime or
production test.

**Evidence:** owner decision dated 2026-09-23; `ARCHITECTURE.md` status
`OWNER APPROVED FOR RA-002 PLANNING`; `RA-001-DECISION-PACK.md`; RA-000 evidence
index; exact baseline above; PR #85; final local/GitHub verification and merge
evidence recorded at closeout.

**Rollback:** revert the documentation commit or amend the draft; runtime is
unchanged and no production rollback exists.

## RA-002 — Canonical contract and common test harness

**Status:** `VERIFIED_COMPLETE`

**Goal:** freeze canonical source, classification, plan and outcome contracts and
prove them against existing implementations in zero-write mode.

**Scope:** reuse/merge existing snapshot schemas, reason registry, offer-sync
artifact schemas and fixtures.

**Out of scope:** production routing and retailer migration.

**Dependencies:** RA-001.

**Existing solutions checked:** `scripts/lib/retailer-snapshot/contracts/`,
`scripts/lib/retailer-offer-sync/contracts/`, atomic plan serialization and
quality-gate manifest. RA-002 reuses the snapshot runtime schema walker,
domain-separated snapshot canonical hashing, frozen local-fixture conventions and the
sealed quality-gate inventory. Existing production schemas, classifiers,
importer, approver, executor and entry points remain unchanged and unwired.

**Acceptance:** one retailer-neutral canonical source contract `v1`; exact-key,
minor-unit money, explicit missing/unknown/source-missing states, six-dimensional
taxonomy and complete reason metadata; deterministic local-fixture replay;
fail-closed write/network boundaries; safe-candidate/authorization separation;
no second executor/importer; quality manifest resealed for the new test.

**Tests:** contract/schema, taxonomy/reasons, determinism, mutation, stale-state,
source collapse, per-row isolation, missing-source semantics, safe candidate
without authorization, equivalent active, genuine system failure, denied
write/network attempts and runtime dependency boundary; quick/full gates.

**Evidence:** `evidence/RA-002.md`, contract/harness source, fixture matrix,
focused test output, deterministic report fingerprint, local quality gates and
PR #86 checks. Independent verification reviewed the complete diff and import
closure, corrected five bounded contract/harness gaps, and repeated the local
and GitHub gates. Production readback is intentionally not applicable because
the module is unwired and local-only.

**Rollback:** contract version remains unused; remove only new harness wiring.

## RA-003 — Historical incident regression fixtures

**Status:** `VERIFIED_COMPLETE`

**Goal:** convert every confirmed incident into a common-harness regression.

**Scope:** price drift, missing source row, identity conflict, active plan,
expired approval, partial session, `PASS_WITH_REVIEW` summary, scheduled queue
publication and post-apply source drift.

**Out of scope:** changing production behavior.

**Dependencies:** RA-002.

**Existing solutions checked:** retailer-specific tests, September recovery
migration tests, eBay reconciliation tests and current Actions artifacts.

**Acceptance:** each confirmed incident has fixture, expected reason/status and
link to original evidence; no unexplained missing regression.

**Tests:** full incident matrix through canonical harness; quick/full gates.

**Evidence:** `evidence/RA-003.md`, the 23-entry incident manifest, 16 executable
fixture/golden pairs, the 81-entry legacy compatibility matrix, independent
mutation and emitter-reference checks, fresh local quality gates and PR #87 CI.

**Rollback:** fixtures/harness only; runtime unchanged.

## RA-004 — 10 Reps shadow-mode pilot

**Status:** `NOT_STARTED`

**Goal:** compare the candidate canonical pipeline with the existing 10 Reps
path, with zero business/control writes.

**Scope:** all 950 approved mappings; current safe/review partition; source,
identity, diff, guard and status parity.

**Out of scope:** cutover, approval creation, apply, queue publication and
baseline widening.

**Dependencies:** RA-002 and RA-003; owner-approved shadow window.

**Existing solutions checked:** shared Fit House engine profile, protected CSV
reader, 950-row manifest, current 935/15 evidence and onboarding fixtures.

**Acceptance:** deterministic parity or explained owner-approved differences;
zero DB writes; no leaked retailer condition in shared core; source failure does
not affect other retailers.

**Tests:** repeated shadow captures, missing-row, price, stock, identity,
collapse and concurrency fixtures; quick/full gates.

**Evidence:** paired artifact digests, row-level parity report, run IDs and
zero-write attestation.

**Rollback:** disable shadow invocation; existing path untouched.

## Retailer migration task template

Each RA-005–RA-015 task has the same mandatory contract:

- **Goal:** migrate exactly one retailer after shadow parity.
- **Scope:** connector/config/fixtures and routing for that retailer only.
- **Out of scope:** another retailer, shared guard weakening, identity cleanup
  without separate owner approval, historical-data rewriting.
- **Dependencies:** RA-004 and evidence-based owner sequencing decision.
- **Existing solutions:** named current connector, parser, manifest, validator,
  executor, postflight, watchdog and tests from `AUDIT.md`.
- **Acceptance:** shadow parity; owner-approved canary; per-row isolation;
  atomic apply; price-history parity; postflight/idempotency/watchdog pass;
  legacy path remains recoverable during observation.
- **Tests:** common harness plus retailer fixtures and every linked incident;
  quick/full gates and isolated integration where applicable.
- **Evidence:** before/after digests, exact scope, run/artifact IDs, production
  readback and no-unrelated-change proof.
- **Rollback:** route back to preserved legacy path; do not delete plans/history.

The IDs below do not establish order:

| Task | Retailer | Status | Additional required proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| RA-005 | Discount Supplements | `NOT_STARTED` | 109 automatic plus 47 residual offers; rename/ownership clarity for `creatine` workflow. |
| RA-006 | Dolphin Fitness | `NOT_STARTED` | one exact automated offer and two unresolved generic legacy identities. |
| RA-007 | eBay UK | `NOT_STARTED` | 237-scope API parity, Review Queue publication, post-apply source-drift closeout and batch workflow retirement decision. |
| RA-008 | Fit House | `NOT_STARTED` | all approved absence/OOS policies, ten deferred changes and removal of Fit-House logic from shared core. |
| RA-009 | GYM HIGH | `NOT_STARTED` | full catalogue atomic parity, legacy identity cases and recognized DB postflight. |
| RA-010 | Jon's Supplements | `NOT_STARTED` | reconcile dedicated production path with existing retailer-snapshot harness; four current reviews. |
| RA-011 | KIOR Health | `NOT_STARTED` | exact 11-row golden path and historical registration hash repair. |
| RA-012 | Predators Gear | `NOT_STARTED` | source access/readiness and owner decision before any apply; 47 stale offers. |
| RA-013 | Simply Supplements | `NOT_STARTED` | Shopify versus historical Awin policy boundary, threshold shipping and aggregate price confirmations. |
| RA-014 | 6 Pack Supplements | `NOT_STARTED` | 506-row WooCommerce parity and consolidation of extensive family/review machinery. |
| RA-015 | Whey Okay | `NOT_STARTED` | resolve missing mapped-source fingerprint row; EKM parsing and 589 automatic/legacy scope boundary. |

## RA-DECOMMISSION — Remove old paths and exceptions

**Status:** `NOT_STARTED`

**Goal:** remove only fully migrated runtime paths and expired exceptions.

**Scope:** dead workflows/scripts/config branches after every applicable retailer
passes observation.

**Out of scope:** data/history deletion, active plans or owner-deferred scope.

**Dependencies:** RA-005–RA-015 verified and RA-OBSERVE complete.

**Existing solutions checked:** workflow archive pattern, quality manifest,
control ledger and exception inventory.

**Acceptance:** no active reference/session; one importer/approval/executor path;
exception removal condition met; tests/docs updated; owner approval.

**Tests:** repository reference scan, quick/full/integration gates, production
readback and rollback rehearsal.

**Evidence:** removal manifest, commit/run/artifact IDs.

**Rollback:** restore routing/code from tagged pre-decommission commit; preserve
DB history.

## RA-OBSERVE — Production observation period

**Status:** `NOT_STARTED`

**Goal:** prove stable operation across owner-approved time and event coverage.

**Scope:** scheduled runs, review backlog, source failures, commercial changes,
postflight/idempotency, watchdog and cross-retailer isolation.

**Out of scope:** feature additions or threshold widening.

**Dependencies:** migrated retailers active; duration decided in RA-001.

**Existing solutions checked:** Actions artifacts, watchdog, Review Queue and
price-history observation mechanisms.

**Acceptance:** required consecutive runs and event cases pass; no unexplained
status; no silent row; no unrelated retailer blockage.

**Tests:** scheduled live evidence plus read-only production checks.

**Evidence:** observation ledger with every run/artifact digest.

**Rollback:** route affected retailer back independently.

## RA-CLOSEOUT — Programme verification

**Status:** `NOT_STARTED`

**Goal:** verify the entire programme and freeze the final architecture record.

**Scope:** contracts, all retailer routes, safety invariants, legacy removal,
documentation and operational ownership.

**Out of scope:** new catalogue/SEO features.

**Dependencies:** all migration tasks, RA-DECOMMISSION and RA-OBSERVE verified.

**Existing solutions checked:** all evidence ledgers and production readbacks.

**Acceptance:** one canonical pipeline; one diff/validator/approval/executor
contract; no unauthorized retailer branch in shared core; all incidents covered;
full gates and independent live verification pass; owner signs closeout.

**Tests:** `verify:project`, quick/full/integration as applicable, contract and
workflow inventory, live read-only watchdog/postflight.

**Evidence:** final commit, CI/live run IDs, artifact digests and owner approval.

**Rollback:** retained release tag and per-retailer routing rollback until owner
ends the rollback window.

## Owner decisions recorded for RA-001

Marek approved on 2026-09-23:

1. `retailer-offer-sync` as the common spine, retaining the existing guarded
   write/control mechanisms and later incorporating snapshot/replay contracts;
2. Model B in principle, with no current auto-safe class, threshold, automatic
   apply or production permission authorized;
3. the separate source/change/execution/run/alert/action taxonomy, including
   `PASS_WITH_REVIEW`, `SKIPPED_EQUIVALENT_ACTIVE` and narrowly scoped
   `FAILED_SYSTEM`;
4. 10 Reps as the first shadow-only pilot and KIOR as the first small later
   cutover candidate, both behind later tasks and separate execution authority;
5. evidence-based legacy-removal gates, with no removal currently authorized
   and GYM HIGH plus Predators Gear remaining deferred.

The unresolved Whey Okay fingerprint cause, Predators source availability,
active plan/session/lock/approval inventory, exact future auto-safe classes,
future GYM HIGH disposition and eBay/GYM event coverage remain explicit future
dependencies. They do not block RA-001 closeout, but block the affected later
migration or activation until resolved. RA-002 is not started by these decisions.
